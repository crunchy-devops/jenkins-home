    Ansible uses colors in its output to indicate different types of messages.<br/>
    <br/>
    If you have a plugin installed (like AnsiColor) you can allow these colors to come through into the Jenkins logs.<br/>
    If you do not have a plugin installed or do not wish to have colors in your logs, checking this box will remove the color codes from the logs.<br/>
    <br/>
    if you do not disable the colors and do not have a plugin installed, the job your output will contain ansi color characters like "[0;32m":<br/>
