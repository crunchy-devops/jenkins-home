    Allow the Tower Connector class (the thing that talks to tower for all jobs) to print debugging messages to the Jenkins log (stdout).<br/>
    This is useful for debugging connection issues.</br>
    Messages will be prefixed with "[Ansible-Tower]" for easy finding.
    <b>This can create alot of data as it logs requests and responses from Tower.</b></br>
